# TextformatterTypographer Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2017-01-04)

- Switch from the old PHP Typography library to the newer, more frequently updated library found at [wp-Typography](https://github.com/mundschenk-at/wp-typography/)
- Config no longer allows the textformatter to be disabled. If you want to turn it off, rather remove it from your field.
- Config no longer allows to reset to defaults. A different implementation of this may be added in the future, if deemed required.
